/**
Many grunt tasks use the wildcard * or ** symbols for deciding which files to include for that task. This is simple and easy BUT doesn't allow much flexibility since if you have a particular directory or file to exclude, it becomes fairly complicated to exclude that file. Furthermore, you have to define (hardcode) this file list in your actual grunt file and you may have to define it many times (or define different variations multiple times). This plugin allows you to define your files (css, js, html) ONCE in a separate config file and gives more flexibility around which files to use where - without relying on blanket file globbing or pattern matching rules. Basically, instead of including all files by default, this plugin does the opposite - it only includes the files you explicity tell it to. This is less error prone since files won't accidentally be included that shouldn't be since each file is specified.

Secondly, this plugin writes grunt templates for you (allowing you to specify a config file in one place then use it to add these config values in all file types (your css, js and html) so you have ONE source of truth. This is especially useful for file paths, which are often shared across your css (i.e. for LESS or SASS pre-processing) and javascript (for http requests or including resources). Can also be used server side so you only need ONE config.json file for your WHOLE app (rather than one config file per language - one for css, one for javascript, one for the server, etc.)


Common use cases:
- forming and stuffing a list of file to lint/jshint and/or minify/uglify (without double linting/uglifying external library files that have already been linted/minified and should NOT be done again). For use with a grunt jshint and/or uglify task.
- forming and stuffing a list of files to concat (for use with a grunt concat task)
- dynamically generating your index.html file with all your <link rel="stylesheet" > css tags, <script> js tags and <script> template cache html files/partials (i.e. for use with AngularJS to preload all your templates for better performance)
- generate other config files (across css, js, html) using grunt template files to stick in config variables defined in a config.json file (this way you don't need to separately set, hardcode and match config variables across css, js, etc.)


More specifically, this plugin takes a buildfilesArray javascript array as a config list of all javascript and css (and html) files and uses them to set the lint, concat, uglify files as well as writes grunt template files (including index.html) to include these resources appropriately.  
Can handle separating external (already minified) files from the rest to avoid any issues with double minification. To use this, set the "dirsExt" key in the buildfilesArray to an array of the directories to NOT uglify/minify.


@toc
1. pull in grunt config
2. init and form file paths
3. set grunt.config paths (for use later in other grunt tasks)
4. write the actual file(s) using the grunt template(s)

@todo - figure out how to make uglify files key be dynamic rather than hardcoded..
